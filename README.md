The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side. WIper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.If there are no wipers, of course, the rainwater that wets the glass will condense and the condition of the glass will become unclear. Not only that, dirt that sticks to the windshield for a long time, of course, is very difficult to remove. If left untreated, of course, will hinder the driverâ€™s view and create a high risk of driving accident.  The concept of this wiper system is similar to other conventional wipers, yet this system will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a controller. When water hits a dedicated sensor located on the windscreen, it triggers the wiper motor to move. If water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop.
